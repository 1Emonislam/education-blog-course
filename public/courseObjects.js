        price: "48",
        body: "No matter if you're just getting started with (web) development, if you're applying for a developer job or if you just need to refresh your knowledge - version control is a core skill you need to succeed as a developer! Git (a version control system) and Github (a cloud provider for Git managed projects) form an outstanding combination to provide the best possible experience to create and maintain a clearly structured project history! This course will guide everyone (no prior knowledge is required!) through the core steps to use these tools in your daily projects with ease. What is Version Control? Saving & accessing data and tracking changes is what version control is all about. No matter if you're working on a private or a professional development project, code evolves, changes and continuously gets improved. A clean version management structure is therefore key to successfully manage the progress of your projects. What is Git? Git is a 100% free version management tool, specifically created for and used by developers all over the world to manage project code history locally on their machines (Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix). What is GitHub? GitHub is an online service, it is also free for many use cases (an account is all you need) and brings Git's local strengths to the cloud. Storing project code online, updating code, accessing other team members' code or collaborating on large scale projects inside your organization - all possible with the help of GitHub! Why Should I Know these Tools? Version control is key to manage projects efficiently so not knowing Git and GitHub makes your daily developer life a lot more complicated. The same apply if you're currently looking for a new job in the industry, version control is required in any developer projects these days, so not knowing Git & GitHub puts you behind your competition! Although Git and GitHub are user friendly, both come with their own logic and Getting started can therefore be a bit cumbersome and this is where this course comes into play! What do I Learn in this Course? This course starts at the very basics, no prior Git or GitHub knowledge is required! You'll learn how to use Git and how to write Git commands in the Mac Terminal or the Windows Command Prompt (optional refreshers on both are also part of the course). Starting with the first initialization of a so-called Git repository, we'll build up your knowledge step-by-step and understand the what & why behind concepts like branches, commits, the staging area, merging & rebasing, cloning, pushing & pulling branches and a lot more!"
